#Very Important

##Please Read

###css
The web browser caches css stylings, therefore, modifications to the css files do not show up until several days later.

To avoid this, change the file name after each modification, and then run python home.py. The browser cannot use what is cached because the names will not match.

DO REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE REFERENCES IN LAYOUT.HTML.
